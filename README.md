# About Me :wave:

I am currently a Software Engineer at [Poly](https://withpoly.com) where we are building an AI integrated cloud storage platform. My role on the ðŸš€ is building a resilient distributed filesystem in Rust.

Starting in July, I will be joining [Apple](https://www.apple.com) as a Software Engineer.

Previously, when I was a graduate student at [Vanderbilt University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanderbilt_University), I worked at the [Institute of Software Integrated Systems](https://www.isis.vanderbilt.edu/) under [Kevin Leach](https://kjl.name). My primary research area was AI Infrastructure Security, where a part of our work recently won an award for best presentation at the ICSE 2024 genetic improvement workshop. I also worked at a cybersecurity startup, [Phosphorus Cybersecurity](https://phosphorus.io/), securing and hacking enterprise IoT devices. 

Before graduate school, I completed my undergraduate degree in Mathematics and Computer Science at Vanderbilt University. I also worked at the Institute of Software Integrated Systems in the [Scope Lab](https://scopelab.ai), researching traffic analysis for optimal ambulance allocation. Before transferring to Vanderbilt, I was a Division 1 athlete at [Furman University](https://www.furman.edu) on the men's lacrosse team.

My non-tech hobbies include strength training and walking my dog.
