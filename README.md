# About Me

I am a graduate student at [Vanderbilt University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanderbilt_University) seeking software engineering roles that start in January 2024.

Currently, I work at the [Institute of Software Integrated Systems](https://www.isis.vanderbilt.edu/) under [Kevin Leach](https://kjl.name). My primary research interests are in AI infrastructure security.

Previously, I have worked in an [academic research lab](https://scopelab.ai) and at a [cybersecurity startup](https://phosphorus.io/).

I completed my undergraduate degree in Mathematics and Computer Science at Vanderbilt University. Before transferring to Vanderbilt, I was a Division 1 athlete at [Furman University](https://www.furman.edu).

My hobbies include strength training and walking my dog.
